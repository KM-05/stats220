# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I think that it is an important/useful cource for computer science
- I am interested in learning about the relationship between data and computer, and how it could be used in a real world application

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![]
